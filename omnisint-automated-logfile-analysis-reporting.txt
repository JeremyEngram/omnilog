Failed Login Analysis:

Extract login attempts from log files.
Identify failed login attempts by searching for specific patterns or error messages.
Analyze the correlation between IP addresses, usernames, and timestamps.
Summarize the top IP addresses with the most failed login attempts.
Identify common usernames or password patterns used in the failed login attempts.
Network Traffic Analysis:

Parse network traffic logs to extract relevant information.
Identify patterns related to network anomalies or suspicious activities.
Analyze source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and timestamps.
Correlate the network traffic with known threat intelligence feeds.
Summarize the top sources or destinations with the most traffic and suspicious behavior.
System Performance Analysis:

Extract system logs related to performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.).
Analyze patterns in performance metrics over time.
Identify correlations between system events and performance issues.
Summarize the top processes or services causing performance degradation.
Highlight any anomalies or deviations from normal behavior.
Application Error Analysis:

Parse application logs to identify error messages or exceptions.
Perform pattern matching to categorize errors based on specific criteria.
Correlate error messages with related application components or modules.
Analyze timestamps and patterns of error occurrences.
Summarize the most common or critical application errors.
These examples showcase how automated log analysis can involve extracting relevant information from log files, performing pattern matching and correlation techniques, and generating a summarized report highlighting key findings or insights. The specific implementation and tools used for log analysis will vary depending on the log format, the target system, and the analysis requirements.
